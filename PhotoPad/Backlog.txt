Backlog - Tim


1. TODOs in code

- after choosing 1, put it in a 2-er collage with a ? or grey square

Main screen
    5. Image downloaded (eyefi): make this bigger?
    6d.old/stale selections -- time them out??
    7. print icon must be much bigger
    8. add ability to email self - email a link set in settings, with a ready-date also set in settings
    8b.app must collect all email addresses -- where does it store them or how does it send them?
    9. update or get rid of help
18. busy-UI while loading imges at start
19. mid-size cache for preview, or other approach to speed up selection & preview generation?
20. localize into german?
21. images printed to collage: apply a style (edit) them?
22. publish to the instagram feed of the wedding??
23. make squares at top to be portrait, not square???? and later have a setting to change it to landscape

More perf: Get rid of selectedPhotos if possible - directly ask for 4ers without asking for 2ers


DONE

1b.DONE: Stop saving images inside app's own xcappdata -- save to photo roll instead, own folder
- max 6 selection

    12.per image in collage: random amount of tilt + zoom, to make things more interesting

    3. DONE: scrolling down thru images is jerky, fix this: image thumbnails too big?
    4. DONE: deselect doesn't work: at least the checkmarks are not removed on deselect
    6. DONE: new images (images downloaded) must be put at START of collection (top left), not bottom
    6b.DONE: if scrolled down in main view, nothing must change until an action is taken (ie print) when new photos come in
    6c.DONE, NEEDS BETTER UI: have some UI indication that newest ones are at the top - a notificaton overlay that appears when new images arrive, touch it to jump to top
    13.app must prevent screen from turning off
