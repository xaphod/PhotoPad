Main screen
    2. DONE: support landscape mode
    3. DONE: scrolling down thru images is jerky, fix this: image thumbnails too big?
    4. DONE: deselect doesn't work: at least the checkmarks are not removed on deselect
    5. Image downloaded (eyefi): make this bigger?
    6. DONE: new images (images downloaded) must be put at START of collection (top left), not bottom
    6b.DONE: if scrolled down in main view, nothing must change until an action is taken (ie print) when new photos come in
