DONE

1b.DONE: Stop saving images inside app's own xcappdata -- save to photo roll instead, own folder
- max 6 selection

    12.per image in collage: random amount of tilt + zoom, to make things more interesting

    3. DONE: scrolling down thru images is jerky, fix this: image thumbnails too big?
    4. DONE: deselect doesn't work: at least the checkmarks are not removed on deselect
    6. DONE: new images (images downloaded) must be put at START of collection (top left), not bottom
    6b.DONE: if scrolled down in main view, nothing must change until an action is taken (ie print) when new photos come in
    6c.DONE, NEEDS BETTER UI: have some UI indication that newest ones are at the top - a notificaton overlay that appears when new images arrive, touch it to jump to top
    13.app must prevent screen from turning off
