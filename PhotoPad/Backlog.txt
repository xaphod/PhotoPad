Backlog - Tim

*** from november 2014
- Email
    - ask for email each time something is printed?
    - show list of existing emails to help know if yours is there?
    - make button position more discoverable, bigger (same with print button)
- next to X button (clear), show lil placeholder squares or numbers to show how many images are selected?
- "instruction area": shows the next step, ie. "Pick at least 2 images!"
- how is german & english mixed wedding working?
- admin settings area, ie. in settings app proper: pick DPI, pick album name (PhotoPad)
- test 150DPI prints compared to 300DPI prints
- perf: resolution is higher for imageview than for print. just generate print res, have imageview stretch?
- check what happens when new photos are arriving via eyefi?


*** before november 2014
- finish email removal logic (todos)
- detect duplicate email entry, warn and don't add a second time
- helper UI - arrows to icons with text
- ppl don't understand they cannot print just 1: make selecting 1, select 1 + a grey photo of question mark etc?
- ppl need more encouragement to select photos
- takes too long until printer starts printing: investigate sending 150dpi and see if it is visibly less quality than 300dpi, and if it is noticeably faster
- 

1. TODOs in code

- after choosing 1, put it in a 2-er collage with a ? or grey square

    9. update or get rid of help
20. localize into german?
22. publish to the instagram feed of the wedding??
