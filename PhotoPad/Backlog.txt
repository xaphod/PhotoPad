Backlog - Tim

0. prep design workpackage for Matt - define asset deliverables (which icons etc)
1. TODOs in code
1b.Stop saving images inside app's own xcappdata -- save to photo roll instead, own folder

Main screen
    2. support landscape mode
    3. scrolling down thru images is jerky, fix this: image thumbnails too big?
    4. deselect doesn't work: at least the checkmarks are not removed on deselect
    5. Image downloaded (eyefi): make this bigger?
    6. new images (images downloaded) must be put at START of collection (top left), not bottom
    7. print icon must be much bigger
    7b.print must only work when at least 2 images are selected: inform user or disable until?
    8. add ability to email self multi-selected images - email a link set up in advance, for marketing / bitsize-upload reasons? send watermarked images, with a link to non-watermarked versions?!
    9. update or get rid of help
    10.add ability to get rid of images (delete them) -- but prevent customer from doing this? only in "admin mode"?
    11.title update - from "browse all photos" to "Photobooth by %companyname%" in prefs

20. localize into german?
21. images printed to collage: apply a style (edit) them?
